This code is modified version of CLASS to incorporate FIMP DM (freebly interacting massive particle DM).

I implement warm dark matter phase-space (momentum) distribution created by freeze-in processes, whose analytic expression is derived in [arXiv:1907.04558](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04558).

For original CLASS code, see http://class-code.net/ and https://github.com/lesgourg/class_public.
